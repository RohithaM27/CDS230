The first method used to calculate the average is a basic mathematical way 
to compute average of numbers. The secong method is a numpy function to get
the average. The average value of the random numbers makes sense 
because the mean of a large number of normally distributed random numbers
has a mean of 0. It also has to do with the symmetry of normal distribution
